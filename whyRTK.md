RTK Query is a powerful data-fetching and state management library built on top of Redux Toolkit. 
It provides a set of tools and conventions for handling data fetching and caching, which can greatly simplify your 
application's data management code and improve performance. Here are some benefits of using RTK Query:

Simplified Data Fetching: RTK Query abstracts away the complexities of making API calls and managing their state. It reduces 
the amount of boilerplate code needed to fetch and manage data, making your codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

Automatic Caching: RTK Query includes an intelligent caching system that automatically stores and updates fetched data in a 
normalized cache. This minimizes unnecessary network requests and enhances the overall application performance.

Automatic Request Deduplication: When multiple components request the same data concurrently, RTK Query will deduplicate the requests, 
ensuring that only one request is made and the data is shared across components.

Real-time Data: RTK Query supports real-time data updates out of the box. When the underlying data changes on the server, 
RTK Query can automatically update the local cache and trigger updates to your components.

Optimistic Updates: You can implement optimistic updates easily with RTK Query, allowing you to update the local state 
optimistically while the actual API call is in progress.

Error Handling: RTK Query provides clear error handling mechanisms, making it easier to manage and display errors that 
occur during data fetching.

Redux Integration: RTK Query seamlessly integrates with Redux Toolkit. It manages its own slice of the Redux store for caching 
and state management, and you can access and modify this data using Redux Toolkit's familiar APIs.

Code Consistency: RTK Query enforces consistent data-fetching patterns across your application, making it easier for your team 
to understand and maintain the codebase.

Type Safety: RTK Query is built with TypeScript support in mind. It generates TypeScript types for your API endpoints, ensuring 
type safety throughout your data fetching code.

Reduced Boilerplate: With RTK Query, you write less boilerplate code for actions, reducers, and selectors. This reduces the 
likelihood of errors and speeds up development.

Ecosystem and Community: RTK Query is developed by the same team behind Redux Toolkit and benefits from the robust ecosystem 
and active community around Redux.

Overall, RTK Query simplifies and streamlines the data-fetching and state management aspects of your application, allowing you to 
focus more on building features and less on managing data flow. It's particularly beneficial for complex applications with multiple 
data sources, real-time updates, and the need for efficient caching strategies.

In RTK Query, a normalized state refers to a specific way of organizing and storing data in the Redux store. Normalization is a technique used to structure complex data in a way that optimizes performance, minimizes redundancy, and simplifies data retrieval.
In a normalized state, data is stored in a "flat" structure with separate slices for each entity type. Each entity is given a unique identifier (usually its ID) and is stored in its corresponding slice. This is particularly useful when dealing with relational or nested data structures.
The benefits of a normalized state in RTK Query are:

Efficient Data Storage: Storing data in a normalized way minimizes data duplication. For example, in the example above, the user data (Alice and Bob) is stored only once even though they are associated with multiple posts.

Faster Updates: Updating individual entities is faster because you can access them directly using their IDs, rather than searching through nested structures.

Simpler Data Retrieval: Retrieving data becomes simpler and more performant, as you can directly access entities by their IDs.

Easier Entity Relationship Handling: When dealing with relational data, normalized state makes it easier to manage relationships between entities.

RTK Query's normalized state management is automatic â€“ when you use RTK Query, it manages data normalization for you behind the scenes. This enables you to focus on building features and querying data without needing to worry about complex data structures or cache management.
