1. You have to install go lang locally - Visit the official Go website at https://golang.org/dl/ to download the latest stable release of Go for your operating system.

2. Download MongoDB: Visit the official MongoDB website at https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community and download the appropriate version of MongoDB for your operating system.

3. React requires Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, to be installed on your machine. Visit the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/ and download the LTS (Long Term Support) version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

The project has  two main parts. Client that is react based and server, that is go lang based.

If the golang is installed and configured properly on your machine, enter the server folder from your command prompt and execute:
`gin --appPort 3000 --immediate` command and the server should be running.

If the nodejs and react are installed properly on your machine, enter the client folder from your command prompt and execute:
`npm i` - to install all the needed packages and then `npm run dev`, to run the client side project. 

At that point you should be setup and everything should work, if not.. don't hesitate to contact me at spasvcholakov@gmail.com or
