webpack-bundle-analyzer is a tool that helps you analyze and visualize the size and composition of your Webpack bundle. It provides valuable insights into how your application's dependencies contribute to the overall bundle size. Here are some reasons why you might consider using webpack-bundle-analyzer:

Identify Large Dependencies: When building a complex web application, you often use various third-party libraries and dependencies. Some of these libraries might contribute significantly to your bundle size. webpack-bundle-analyzer helps you identify which dependencies are consuming the most space in your bundle, enabling you to make informed decisions about their usage.

Optimize Bundle Size: Large bundle sizes can impact your application's performance, especially for users with slower internet connections or on mobile devices. By visualizing the sizes of individual modules and chunks, you can identify opportunities to optimize your bundle size by selectively importing only the necessary parts of a library or removing unused code.

Tree Shaking and Dead Code Elimination: With tools like Tree Shaking and Dead Code Elimination, you can remove unused code from your bundle, reducing its size. webpack-bundle-analyzer can help you verify that these techniques are effectively removing dead code and reducing the bundle size as expected.

Prevent Code Duplication: Sometimes, different parts of your application might import the same dependencies separately, resulting in code duplication. webpack-bundle-analyzer can highlight these cases, prompting you to centralize the imports and potentially decrease the bundle size.

Profile Development and Production Builds: The tool can be used to analyze both development and production builds, giving you insights into how your bundle sizes change between these two modes. It's essential to ensure that your production build remains optimized and doesn't include unnecessary development-related code or dependencies.

Debug Performance Bottlenecks: Large bundles can lead to longer load times, impacting user experience. webpack-bundle-analyzer helps you identify and debug performance bottlenecks by visualizing how resources are distributed across different parts of your application.

Make Data-Driven Decisions: Instead of relying on assumptions, webpack-bundle-analyzer provides visual evidence of your bundle's composition. This data-driven approach allows you to make informed decisions about optimizing your application's performance and user experience.

Overall, webpack-bundle-analyzer is a valuable tool for anyone working with Webpack-based projects, helping you make your application more efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly by optimizing its bundle size.
